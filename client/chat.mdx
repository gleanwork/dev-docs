<Warning>This API is **experimental** and there may be breaking changes as it evolves.</Warning>

## Overview

The Glean Chat API provides a programmatic interface to interact with the Glean chat system. It allows developers to send and receive messages and handle conversation streams.

The Glean Chat API utilizes a streaming POST endpoint at `https://<your-domain>-be.glean.com/rest/api/v1/chat` for continuous, real-time conversational interactions. Remember to replace `<your-domain-be>` with your specific domain.

## Setup
First, a Glean admin at https://app.glean.com/admin/setup/gleanassistant must set a key with access to GPT-4 as well as who has access to the Glean Assistant.

## Authentication
Glean’s Chat API uses the standard HTTP Authorization header to transmit the bearer token, similar to Glean’s Client REST API authentication methods.

`CHAT` scoped bearer tokens are required to interact with Glean’s Chat API and can be generated from the admin console. More details about token permissions, scopes and generation can be found [here](https://developers.glean.com/docs/client_api/client_api_scopes/).

Please note that all samples in the document assume the usage of a user-permissioned token.
For a global-permissioned token, you would need to add an additional ‘X-Scio-Actas’ HTTP header to make the request on behalf of another user in your company. You can learn about making your first request [here](https://developers.glean.com/docs/client_api/client_api_first_request/).

## Personalisation & Privacy
Glean Search and Glean Chat ensure personalized search results based on your document access permissions. Be aware, if a user-permissioned token is used, the results might reflect your private information. Similarly, with a global token, the response may include private data of the user specified in the X-Scio-Actas HTTP header. **This feature is designed to enhance data relevance, but it's important to be mindful of the privacy implications**. Handle your tokens with care to maintain your personal information's confidentiality.
