<Note>
Glean does not support OAuth tokens natively. An IdP is required to manage the token creation.

### OAuth Access Tokens
Admins can enable this feature in [Glean's Client API Settings](#navigating-to-client-api-settings). To enable use of OAuth access tokens with our Rest APIs,
click on the toggle labeled "Allow OAuth token-based access." You will need to provide the following:
1. Your desired OAuth provider (Azure, GSuite, Okta, and OneLogin are supported),
2. The issuer subdomain, if your provider is not GSuite. This value can be found on the payload of your JWT access tokens, and should have one of the following formats:
   - `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<directory_ID>/v2.0` for Azure
   - `https://<subdomain>.okta.com` for Okta
   - `https://<subdomain>.onelogin.com/oidc/2` for OneLogin
3. A comma-separated list of Client IDs of the applications for which your access tokens will be issued.

Once saved, your settings may need up to 10 minutes to take effect.

### Using access tokens

To use an OAuth access token to authenticate against the Rest API, set the following HTTP headers:
- `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
- `X-Glean-Auth-Type: OAUTH`

Note that OAuth access tokens are treated as user-permissioned tokens with access to all of the [scopes](#scopes) listed below.

**If using GSuite access tokens**, please ensure that your tokens are granted the following [scopes](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes#oauth2):
- `openid`
- `email`
- `profile`
