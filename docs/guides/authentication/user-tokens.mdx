User tokens are special tokens that are generated by the Glean server that are used to identify a particular user. They are used to authenticate to the Client API when a user is making a request on behalf of a user. The user's email is used to generate the token, and the token is then used to authenticate the user to the Client API.

<Steps>

<Step title="Ensuring accurate token information">
- The permissions for the token should be set to `USER`, the user email should be set to a valid user email (say, `john.doe@yourdomain.com`) while creating the token.
- The scope list for the token should contain the `COLLECTIONS` scope.
</Step>

<Step title="Making the request">
Use the following cURL command to create a collection.

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://customer-be.glean.com/rest/api/v1/createcollection \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
-d '{
     "name": "Sample Collection - '$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")'",
     "description": "A brief summary of the collection\'s contents."
}'
```

<Warning>
If you get a response with a status code other that `200`, use the error response to figure out what might have gone wrong. For example, the token may have expired, causing the request to fail.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Verifying the collection">
Go to the [Collections tab](https://app.glean.com/knowledge/collections) to verify that your collection has been created! Don't forget to delete the test collection once you're done!

<Tip>
As seen in the screenshot below, the email provided was identical to that of the user-logged in. If that is not the case, the `Created By` field will reflect the appropriate creator, based on the inferred email.
