The Glean Python SDK provides a simple interface to the Glean Indexing API. This is a convenient way to index documents into Glean from your Python application.

## Tokens
All Indexing API endpoints require a Bearer Auth token. You can obtain a token scoped to the datasource you want to interact with. Obtain the API token from your Glean admin. Store this token in a secure place.

<Info>
Glean admins can manage Indexing API tokens via the [**API tokens page within the admin console**](https://app.glean.com/admin/platform/tokenManagement) (Admin console > Platform > API tokens > Indexing tokens tab). Please refer to the [Managing API tokens](https://developers.glean.com/docs/indexing_api/indexing_api_tokens/) tutorial to get more information on API tokens.
</Info>

Determine the host you need to connect to. This will be the URL of the backend for your Glean deployment, for example, customer-be.glean.com

## Installation

In the tutorials, we use curl and python for example API requests. You can also use the
python SDK for production code.

<Steps>

<Step title="Install the indexing API python sdk locally">

```shell
pip install https://app.glean.com/meta/indexing_api_client.zip
```
</Step>

<Step title="Set up the API client">

```python
import glean_indexing_api_client as indexing_api
# Configure host and Bearer authorization: BearerAuth
configuration = indexing_api.Configuration(
  host="http://customer-be.glean.com/api/index/v1", access_token="<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"
)
api_client = indexing_api.ApiClient(configuration)
```

</Step>

You can find documentation for the python SDK under the [SDK reference](https://developers.glean.com/docs/sdk/readme/)
