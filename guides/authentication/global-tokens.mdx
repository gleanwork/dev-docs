Global tokens are special tokens that can be used to authenticate to the Client API on behalf of any user in the system. These tokens are created by Glean and can be used for any user who is a member of the company that has access to the Glean platform. The user email is not set when creating a global token, but the `X-Scio-Actas` HTTP header must be specified when making a request to the Client API, with the email of the user on whose behalf the request is intended to be made.


<Steps>

<Step title="Ensuring accurate token information">
- The user email would not be set.
- The permissions for the token should be set to `GLOBAL`
- The scope list for the token should contain the `COLLECTIONS` scope.
</Step>

<Step title="Making the request">

- Use the following cURL command to create a collection
- Replace `<User email>` in the `X-Scio-Actas` header with a valid email address of a user on whose behalf the request is intended to be made.

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://customer-be.glean.com/rest/api/v1/createcollection \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
-H 'X-Scio-Actas: <User email>' \
-d '{
     "name": "Sample Collection - '$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")'",
     "description": "A brief summary of the collection\'s contents."
}'
```

<Warning>
If you get a response with a status code other that `200`, use the error response to figure out what might have gone wrong. For example, the token may have expired, causing the request to fail.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Verifying the collection">

- Go to the [Collections tab](https://app.glean.com/knowledge/collections) to verify that your collection has been created! Don't forget to delete the test collection once you're done!

<Tip>

As seen in the screenshot below, the email provided was identical to that of the user-logged in. If that is not the case, the `Created By` field will reflect the appropriate creator, based on the inferred email.
