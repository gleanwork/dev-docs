Each token should have one associated permission and one or more scopes to be usable.

<Warning>
The permissions and scopes assigned to a token cannot be changed after the token is created. Carefully select these attributes during token creation.
</Warning>

### User Tokens
These tokens can make API calls on behalf of a particular user. The user email is fixed while creating the token. The `X-Scio-ActAs` HTTP header must be **empty**.


### Global Tokens
These tokens can make API calls on behalf of any user in the system. To identify the user for each API call, the `X-Scio-ActAs` HTTP header must be **included**, specifying the user's email address.

<Info>
Tokens with `GLOBAL` permissions can only be created by Super Admin users.
</Info>

### Anonymous Tokens
These tokens can make API calls on behalf of an anonymous user. The `X-Scio-ActAs` HTTP header must be **empty**.

<Info>
`ANONYMOUS` permissions are supported only for a few endpoints as of now. Please contact Glean support if you're interested to use such tokens.
</Info>

## Scopes
Scopes define the endpoints that are available to a token. When you create a token, you will select the permission and scope(s) in the "Add Client API Token" dialogue box as described in the token creation steps.
