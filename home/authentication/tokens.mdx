The developer-ready Client API endpoints can be accessed via one of two types of Bearer tokens: [OAuth Access Tokens](#oauth-access-tokens) issued by an SSO provider or [Glean-issued tokens](#glean-issued-tokens). Both methods can be used concurrently, but we recommend using OAuth access tokens for a more secure authentication for Client API requests, scoped to the individual user it's issued to.

## Generating Tokens
Tokens can be generated through Glean's UI or through [OAuth](./oauth) via a supporting IdP. To create tokens in [Glean's Client API Settings](#navigating-to-client-api-settings) you must be an admin.


1. Click on the wrench icon in the left navigation bar. This will open up the admin console.
2. On the left sidebar, navigate to **Setup** and select **API Tokens**.
3. In the API Tokens page, select the **Client Tokens** tab. Here you can see a list of all token metadata (note that the token itself won't be visible).
4. To create a new token, click **Add New Token**. In the dialogue box, fill in appropriate values for Description, Permissions, Scopes, and Expires fields, then click **Save**.

<Warning>
The newly created token secret will only be visible once after its creation. Please ensure you save it securely as you won't be able to retrieve it later.
</Warning>
